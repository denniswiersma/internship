# Internship
This repository contains code and writings for my internship project at the Computational Transcriptomics research group at University Medical Center Groningen.
The project is part of the fourth (and final) year of the bachelor Bio-information technology at Hanze University of Applied Sciences.

## Annotation of large-scale transcriptomic data using machine learning techniques

[adaptation of project proposal introduction]

## Usage

### Acquiring code & data

### Setting configurations
- Copy config_template.toml and name config.toml
- Required changes
- Mention makeup of runID when discussing output directories.

### Recommended usage
- Call code from Jupyter notebook and treat code in ml directory as a "backend".

## Organisation

- Each (top level?) folder has its own readme.

### documents
- Explain that this contains any documents that need to be produced for this project.
- Documents are written in latex. Further documentation on how to "compile" can be found in the folder.

### eda
- contains code for exploring the dataset

### ml

### notebooks

### config_template.toml

### data.py
