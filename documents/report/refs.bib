	abstract = {Predictions of the secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme, made by a number of investigators on the basis of the amino acid sequence, are compared with the structure of the protein determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography. Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both β-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140--142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.},

@article{mcc:multi,
	abstract = {Predicted assignments of biological sequences are often evaluated by Matthews correlation coefficient. However, Matthews correlation coefficient applies only to cases where the assignments belong to two categories, and cases with more than two categories are often artificially forced into two categories by considering what belongs and what does not belong to one of the categories, leading to the loss of information. Here, an extended correlation coefficient that applies to K-categories is proposed, and this measure is shown to be highly applicable for evaluating prediction of RNA secondary structure in cases where some predicted pairs go into the category ``unknown'' due to lack of reliability in predicted pairs or unpaired residues. Hence, predicting base pairs of RNA secondary structure can be a three-category problem. The measure is further shown to be well in agreement with existing performance measures used for ranking protein secondary structure predictions.

	abstract = {This study presents a machine learning approach using conditional inference tree (Ctree) to determine cognitive patterns that elicit consumer engagement into social media. Using the Ctree algorithm, a predictive model was computed using self-reported data on consumers' perceptions of brand equity and engagement into brand-related social media behavior from a sample of 1356 individuals. The predictive modeling analysis revealed 5 different cognitive patterns (rules) that stimulate brand-related social media behavior. Each rule comprises behavioral engagement discriminating low, medium, and high levels of consumption, contribution, and creation of brand-related social media content. Furthermore, based on the different patterns, the analysis portrait a typology of 5 subtypes of consumers according to their behavior, which by complementing the predictive analysis information may be used to stimulate different levels of consumption, contribution, and creation of brand-related social media content.},

However, it is not straightforward to provide business recommendations based on the results of the PHM. We use a novel method, namely the Conditional Inference Tree, to conduct the reliability analysis for the automobile engines data, provided by a UK fleet company. We find that the reliability of automobile engines is significantly related to the vehicle age, early failure, and repair history. Our tree-structured model can be easily interpreted, and tangible business recommendations are provided for the fleet management and maintenance.},

@article{gs:def_bon,
	abstract = {Long-term predictions of forest dynamics, including forecasts of tree growth and mortality, are central to sustainable forest-management planning. Although often difficult to evaluate, tree mortality rates under different abiotic and biotic conditions are vital in defining the long-term dynamics of forest ecosystems. In this study, we have modeled tree mortality rates using conditional inference trees (CTREE) and multi-year permanent sample plot data sourced from an inventory with coverage of New Brunswick (NB), Canada. The final CTREE mortality model was based on four tree- and three stand-level terms together with two climatic terms. The correlation coefficient (R2) between observed and predicted mortality rates was 0.67. High cumulative annual growing degree-days (GDD) was found to lead to increased mortality in 18 tree species, including Betula papyrifera, Picea mariana, Acer saccharum, and Larix laricina. In another ten species, including Abies balsamea, Tsuga canadensis, Fraxinus americana, and Fagus grandifolia, mortality rates tended to be higher in areas with high incident solar radiation. High amounts of precipitation in NB's humid maritime climate were also found to contribute to heightened tree mortality. The relationship between high GDD, solar radiation, and high mortality rates was particularly strong when precipitation was also low. This would suggest that although excessive soil water can contribute to heightened tree mortality by reducing the supply of air to the roots, occasional drought in NB can also contribute to increased mortality events. These results would have significant implications when considered alongside regional climate projections which generally entail both components of warming and increased precipitation.},

@article{gs:alpha2,
	abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation often co-occur in a landscape and their relative influence on a native animals' health and survival can be difficult to determine. We examined the influence of these environmental variables on the estimated relative abundance of some small mammal species in a large area (∼2500km2) of southeastern Australia. Using the agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis) as a model, we also examined the association between these variables and three population performance indices, mass-size residuals (MSR; indexing fat reserves), the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (N:L; indexing physiological stress) and red blood cell counts (RBC; indexing regenerative anaemia). Study sites were in either highly disturbed and fragmented, or relatively undisturbed, continuous Eucalyptus forest. We generated conditional inference tree statistical models to identify the relative importance of up to 49 ecological variables in explaining variation in small mammal abundance and performance indices. Habitat loss was important in explaining small mammal abundance, as were the abundances of the same species in neighbouring study sites. The models also suggested that the habitat area required to support a `healthy' population was greater in the larger species examined. Autocovariates of neighbouring site same-species abundances and habitat fragmentation were the next most important influences on small mammal relative abundance, implying that metapopulations may be important for population persistence, especially in bush rats (Rattus fuscipes). Habitat degradation, reflected in structural and floristic features, was less important, but explained some variance in relative abundances. For agile antechinus populations, time of year, degree of forest fragmentation and extent of native tree cover were important in explaining performance indices. Results indicated that habitat reduction per se was a significant threatening process for small mammals. Habitat loss requires at least the same research attention as that currently devoted to anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and degradation.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine the risk factors of developing functional decline and make probabilistic predictions by using a tree-based method that allows higher order polynomials and interactions of the risk factors. Methods The conditional inference tree analysis, a data mining approach, was used to construct a risk stratification algorithm for developing functional limitation based on BMI and other potential risk factors for disability in 1,951 older adults without functional limitations at baseline (baseline age 73.1 $\pm$ 4.2 y). We also analyzed the data with multivariate stepwise logistic regression and compared the two approaches (e.g., cross-validation). Over a mean of 9.2 $\pm$ 1.7 years of follow-up, 221 individuals developed functional limitation. Results Higher BMI, age, and comorbidity were consistently identified as significant risk factors for functional decline using both methods. Based on these factors, individuals were stratified into four risk groups via the conditional inference tree analysis. Compared to the low-risk group, all other groups had a significantly higher risk of developing functional limitation. The odds ratio comparing two extreme categories was 9.09 (95\% confidence interval: 4.68, 17.6). Conclusions Higher BMI, age, and comorbid disease were consistently identified as significant risk factors for functional decline among older individuals across all approaches and analyses.},

@article{ctree:bias,
	abstract = {A common approach to split selection in classification trees is to search through all possible splits generated by predictor variables. A splitting criterion is then used to evaluate those splits and the one with the largest criterion value is usually chosen to actually channel samples into corresponding subnodes. However, this greedy method is biased in variable selection when the numbers of the available split points for each variable are different. Such result may thus hamper the intuitively appealing nature of classification trees. The problem of the split selection bias for two-class tasks with numerical predictors is examined. The statistical explanation of its existence is given and a solution based on the P-values is provided, when the Pearson chi-square statistic is used as the splitting criterion.},

This is despite of the fact that accuracy does not compensate for hits that can be attributed to mere chance. Is it a meaningful flaw in the context of machine learning? Are we using the wrong meter for decades? The results of this study do suggest that the answers to these questions are positive. Cohen's kappa, a meter that does compensate for random hits, was compared with accuracy, using a benchmark of fifteen datasets and five well-known classifiers. It turned out that the average probability of a hit being the result of mere chance exceeded one third (!). It was also found that the proportion of random hits varied with different classifiers that were applied even to a single dataset. Consequently, the rankings of classifiers' accuracy, with and without compensation for random hits, differed from each other in eight out of the fifteen datasets. Therefore, accuracy may well fail in its main task, namely to properly measure the accuracy-wise merits of the classifiers themselves.},

The integrated Brier score is used for the evaluation of predictive models. We analyse data of a large trial on node positive breast cancer patients conducted by the German Breast Cancer Study Group and a smaller 'pilot' study on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where prognostic factors are derived from microarray expression values. In addition, simulation experiments underline the predictive power of our proposal.},

@article{ari:rand,
	abstract = {The problem of comparing two different partitions of a finite set of objects reappears continually in the clustering literature. We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between $\pm$1.},

@article{bhat:cna,
	abstract = {Copy number alterations (CNAs) can promote tumor progression by altering gene expression levels. Due to transcriptional adaptive mechanisms, however, CNAs do not always translate proportionally into altered expression levels. By reanalyzing >34,000 gene expression profiles, we reveal the degree of transcriptional adaptation to CNAs in a genome-wide fashion, which strongly associate with distinct biological processes. We then develop a platform-independent method---transcriptional adaptation to CNA profiling (TACNA profiling)---that extracts the transcriptional effects of CNAs from gene expression profiles without requiring paired CNA profiles. By applying TACNA profiling to >28,000 patient-derived tumor samples we define the landscape of transcriptional effects of CNAs. The utility of this landscape is demonstrated by the identification of four genes that are predicted to be involved in tumor immune evasion when transcriptionally affected by CNAs. In conclusion, we provide a novel tool to gain insight into how CNAs drive tumor behavior via altered expression levels.},
