\chapter{Discussion \& Conclusion}
Normal samples might not actually be normal. stefan sent a paper about this?

If Bonferroni performs worse than univariate in the forest, this might be explained by the many trees in the forest already taking care of the multiple testing.
Rational on this should be in the paper describing cforest.

\section{Summary of Results}
Literally repeat your goals and couple them to your results.

Summarise results and give your interpretation of them.

Discuss consequences and reliability of your results.

\section{Discussion}
Compare results to literature.

Discuss surprising or striking results.

Discuss weaknesses and how to address them.

What was not tried?
e.g., neural networks.

What could I not do?
Time constraints, knowledge constraints, compute constraints.

Think about useful continuations, e.g., if we can predict cancer types, maybe we can predict other things as well.

\section{General Conclusions \& Perspective}
Discuss your goals, the end result, and how to move on from here.

Discuss social and/or scientific implications.
